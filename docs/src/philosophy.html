              <p>This course is created with an intentional learning philosophy. </p>

            </div>
            
        </li>
        
        
        <li id="section-3">
            <div class="annotation">
              
              <div class="pilwrap ">
                <a class="pilcrow" href="#section-3">&#182;</a>
              </div>
              <p>My motivation comes from: When I was learning I struggled with a lot of concepts. Over time, I pieced together the answers, but they were all over the place and it took years. I wanted to provide as many of those answers in one place, as best as I could. </p>

            </div>
            
        </li>
        
        
        <li id="section-4">
            <div class="annotation">
              
              <div class="pilwrap ">
                <a class="pilcrow" href="#section-4">&#182;</a>
              </div>
              <p>The course has also changed a lot over time. Initially it was very language-focused. Now, I’ve revised the content to focus heavily on bigger, real-world exmaples that encompass the previous concepts. I believe that will leave a more lasting impression on the learner. I also feel that this type of content is what is often missing in the learning space. The “pulling it all together” part. </p>

            </div>
            
        </li>
        
        
        <li id="section-5">
            <div class="annotation">
              
              <div class="pilwrap ">
                <a class="pilcrow" href="#section-5">&#182;</a>
              </div>
              <p>I like to run the content where individuals go through the exercises themselves, but then come together at the end to share their solutions. By doing this, people can see the different considerations of the others and share ideas. </p>

            </div>
            
        </li>
        
        
        <li id="section-6">
            <div class="annotation">
              
              <div class="pilwrap ">
                <a class="pilcrow" href="#section-6">&#182;</a>
              </div>
              <p>One big goal is to try and make the course informative, yet applicable. Informative to understand the <em>why</em> things work the way they do, but also to give as strong a direction and opinion as I can possibly give. To take a stand and say: “Do it this way” with as much authority as I can reasonably muster. To live alongside this, all exercises are implemented using TDD styles. I believe strongly that implementing using TDD and testing is such a vital important part of learning a language. </p>

            </div>
            
        </li>
        
        
        <li id="section-7">
            <div class="annotation">
              
              <div class="pilwrap ">
                <a class="pilcrow" href="#section-7">&#182;</a>
              </div>
              <p>The content is designed more as a guide than a read-from-start-to-finish linear learning path. I don’t believe learning is linear, and I think we learn best from doing. With this in mind, I intend the learner to get to the exercise as soon as possible, and use these real examples as the jumping-off point needed to colour explanations appropriately. </p>

            </div>
            
        </li>
        
        
        <li id="section-8">
            <div class="annotation">
              
              <div class="pilwrap ">
                <a class="pilcrow" href="#section-8">&#182;</a>
              </div>
              <p>But it’s the non-linear nature that is why I created the content so that it’s as easy to return to as possible. In fact, it helps me to keep refining the content and improving it for my own growth, there’s no way someone could grasp it all in one go… unless you like drinking from a firehose! So push the boundaries, ask questions, experiment, re-visit, re-learn, teach others and eventually things will start to fall into place. Just remember that you’ll never understand it all, but you should strive to hold the principles. </p>
