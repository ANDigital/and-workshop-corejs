# CORE JS WORKSHOP

## Getting Started...

1 - fork and clone this repo on your machine
2 - install or update nodejs to the latest version (8): ```brew install node```
3 - install [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) globally: ```npm install -g jest```
4 - install nodemon globally: ```npm install -g nodemon```
5 - install node modules: ```npm install```

** You should run the test individually **

```jest --watch <test-file>```

For the non test file, use nodemon to automatically load the change you (eventually) make

```
nodemon <file>
```
