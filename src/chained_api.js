// # Chained API

// A chained API is a design pattern that returns a reference to the same object in each of it's methods

// You would do this in order to facilitate appending objects onto another

// This could be argued as a type of re-use through composition, however it's a more object oriented style of programming as it often makes use of the ```this``` keyword.
